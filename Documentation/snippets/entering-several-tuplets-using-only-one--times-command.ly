The property @code{tupletSpannerDuration} sets how long each of the
tuplets contained within the brackets after @code{\\tuplet} should last.
Many consecutive tuplets can then be placed within a single
@code{\\tuplet} expression, thus saving typing.

There are several ways to set @code{tupletSpannerDuration}.  The command
@code{\\tupletSpan} sets it to a given duration, and clears it when
instead of a duration @code{\\default} is specified.  Another way is
to use an optional argument with @code{\\tuplet}.
