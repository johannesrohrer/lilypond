The beams of consecutive 16th (or shorter) notes are, by default, not
subdivided.  That is, the three (or more) beams stretch unbroken over
entire groups of notes.  This behavior can be modified to subdivide the
beams into sub-groups by setting the property @code{subdivideBeams}.
When set, multiple beams will be subdivided at intervals defined by the
current value of @code{baseMoment} by reducing the multiple beams to
just one beam between the sub-groups. Note that @code{baseMoment}
defaults to one over the denominator of the current time signature if
not set explicitly. It must be set to a fraction giving the duration of
the beam sub-group using the @code{ly:make-moment} function, as shown
in this snippet. Also, when @code{baseMoment} is changed,
@code{beatStructure} should also be changed to match the new
@code{baseMoment}:
