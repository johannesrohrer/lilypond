Creating a delayed turn, where the lower note of the turn uses the
accidental, requires several overrides.  The
@code{outside-staff-priority} property must be set to @code{#f}, as
otherwise this would take precedence over the @code{avoid-slur
property}.  The value of @code{halign} is used to position the turn
horizontally.
