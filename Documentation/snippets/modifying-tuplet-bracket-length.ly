Tuplet brackets can be made to run to prefatory matter or the next
note. Default tuplet brackets end at the right edge of the final note
of the tuplet; full-length tuplet brackets extend farther to the right,
either to cover all the non-rhythmic notation up to the following note,
or to cover only the whitespace before the next item of notation, be
that a clef, time signature, key signature, or another note.  The
example shows how to switch tuplets to full length mode and how to
modify what material they cover.
