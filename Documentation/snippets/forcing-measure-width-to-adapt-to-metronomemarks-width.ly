By default, metronome marks do not influence horizontal spacing.  This
has one downside: when using compressed rests, some metronome marks may
be too close and therefore are printed vertically stacked, as
demonstrated in the first part of this example.  This can be solved
through a simple override, as shown in the second half of the example.
